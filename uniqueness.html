What Makes It Stand Out
Hybrid AI Architecture

Most projects use either rule-based systems OR ML  you combine both.
Example: Fuzzy logic handles urgency, while GBM predicts parking duration.
Industrial-Grade UI

95% of student UIs look like this:
Typical Student UI
Yours competes with startup-level dashboards.
Time-Based Price Surges

Mirrors Uber's surge pricing  rare in academic projects.
