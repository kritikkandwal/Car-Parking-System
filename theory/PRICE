Step-by-Step Explanation
Endpoint Declaration:

Route: The endpoint is defined as /reserve/<int:slot_id>, meaning it expects an integer parameter slot_id in the URL.
Method: It accepts POST requests, which are used to make changes (i.e., reserve a slot).
Slot ID Validation:

Validation Check:
python
Copy
Edit
if slot_id < 1 or slot_id > len(parking_lots):
This condition ensures that the provided slot_id is within the valid range of available parking slots.
Invalid ID Handling:
If the slot_id is out of range, the function immediately returns a JSON response indicating failure:
python
Copy
Edit
return jsonify({"status": "failed", "message": "Invalid slot ID"})
Retrieving the Parking Slot:

Slot Selection:
python
Copy
Edit
slot = parking_lots[slot_id - 1]
The code fetches the corresponding parking slot from the parking_lots list. Note that it subtracts 1 because list indexing starts at 0.
Checking Slot Availability and User Balance:

Availability & Balance Check:
python
Copy
Edit
if slot['status'] == 'free' and user_account["balance"] >= slot['price']:
The slot must be marked as free (i.e., available for reservation).
The user must have a balance equal to or greater than the slot's price.
Failure Case:
If either condition fails, the function returns a JSON response indicating failure:
python
Copy
Edit
return jsonify({"status": "failed", "message": "Insufficient balance or slot not free"})
Deducting the Slot Price from User Balance:

Deduction Operation:
python
Copy
Edit
user_account["balance"] -= slot['price']
This line subtracts the parking slot’s price directly from the user's current balance.
Key Point:
user_account["balance"] holds the current balance, and after this operation, it reflects the updated balance post-deduction.
Updating Slot Status:

Marking as Reserved:
python
Copy
Edit
slot['status'] = 'reserved'
After deducting the price, the slot is no longer available, so its status is updated to reserved.
Setting Reservation Timeout:

Timeout Setup:
python
Copy
Edit
reservations[slot_id] = time.time() + 300
The code records a reservation expiry time by taking the current time and adding 300 seconds (i.e., a 5-minute reservation window).
Returning the Response:

Success Response:
python
Copy
Edit
return jsonify({
    "status": "success",
    "until": reservations[slot_id],
    "new_balance": user_account["balance"]
})
A JSON response is sent back to the client, confirming the reservation.
It includes:
"status": "success" – Indicating that the reservation was successful.
"until": reservations[slot_id] – The timestamp until which the reservation is valid.
"new_balance": user_account["balance"] – The updated balance after the slot’s price has been deducted.
Summary
Validation: The code first validates the slot ID.
Condition Checks: It verifies that the selected slot is free and the user has enough balance.
Deduction: The slot's price is deducted directly from the user's balance (user_account["balance"]).
State Update: The slot is marked as reserved, and a timeout is set.
Response: Finally, a JSON response is returned showing the reservation details and the new balance.
